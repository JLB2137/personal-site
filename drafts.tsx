My introduction to web frameworks was building a basic site using the Giphy API. 
I used promises and ajax to return an array of images using the open source Giphy API.
Using DOM manipulation and jQuery the site allows the user to search for gifs with a rating system.
The user can then search through the deck and copy the gif to their clipboard.
