        <p>I graduated from Tufts University in 2019 with a Bachelors in Science in Biomedical Engineering.
            Since then I have used my engineering skills to pursue my passions including my transition into web development.
            I spent September 2021 through April 2022 taking the General Assembly Full-Stack Web Development to get acquianted
            with the latest tools and frameworks being used on the web today! I spend my free time building web apps
            to help solve problems inlcuding tracking investments and watering my plants!
